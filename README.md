# WhereCanIEat
As someone who suffers from severe allergies, I am always trying to figure out if I will be able to eat at restaurants around me. Some restaurants have nuts in their kitchens, others are very careful to avoid contamination and others have no nuts at all. Servers at these restaurants also have varying degrees of understanding of what it means to have a severe allergy.
